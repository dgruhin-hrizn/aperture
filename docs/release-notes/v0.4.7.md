# Aperture v0.4.7 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release focuses on dashboard improvements and bug fixes to make your home screen more useful.

---

## ✨ New Features

### Two-Column Recently Watched

The Recently Watched card on the dashboard now displays **Movies** and **Series** in separate columns, making better use of the available space.

- **Movies column** (left): Shows your recently watched movies with play count
- **Series column** (right): Shows recently watched series with the last episode watched (e.g., S2E5)

### Improved Time Display

- **Recently Watched**: Now shows months and years for older items (e.g., "2mo 15d ago", "1y 3mo ago")
- **Recent Ratings**: Displays "Rated on Jan 11, 2026" format instead of relative time

### Libraries Excluded from Global Search

AI-generated libraries are now **excluded from global search** in Emby/Jellyfin. This keeps your search results clean — when you search for a movie, you'll only see results from your main libraries, not duplicates from AI recommendation libraries.

**Affected libraries:**

- 🍿 AI Movie Recommendations
- 📺 AI Series Recommendations
- 🏆 Top Picks libraries
- 👀 Shows You Watch libraries

**Note:** Re-running the "Build Aperture Libraries" job will apply this setting to existing libraries.

### Library Default Sort: Date Added

AI recommendation libraries now **default to "Date Added" sort** (newest first) when users first visit them. This means your most recent recommendations appear at the top.

- Set automatically when granting users library access
- Uses the correct Emby Web / Jellyfin Web client identifiers
- Once a user changes their sort preference, it's remembered by their browser

**Affected libraries:**

- 🍿 AI Movie Recommendations
- 📺 AI Series Recommendations
- 🏆 Top Picks libraries
- 👀 Shows You Watch libraries

### No Duplicates in Continue Watching

Aperture libraries no longer cause **duplicate entries in Continue Watching**. Previously, if you watched a movie from an AI recommendation library, both the original AND the Aperture copy would appear in Continue Watching.

**The fix:** Aperture NFO files now:

1. **Omit external IDs** (IMDB, TMDB, TVDB) - prevents linking to originals
2. **Set `<lockdata>true`** - prevents Emby from auto-fetching IDs from online sources

**Why it works:** When you play a STRM file, Emby tracks playback on the item that **owns the actual media file** (the original), not the STRM pointer. Our watch history sync only matches items in our database (which only contains originals), so watch history stays accurate.

**Result:**

- ✅ Continue Watching shows only the original (no duplicates)
- ✅ Watch history is correctly tracked on the original
- ✅ Recommendations work as expected

**Note:** This fix requires **STRM mode** (not symlink mode). To apply:

1. Set `AI Recs Output > Movies Use Symlinks` to **false** in Settings
2. Re-run the "Build Aperture Libraries" job
3. The job will automatically clean up old symlinks and create STRM files with NFO files that have no external IDs

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Library Options Fix (CollectionType Preservation)

Fixed a critical bug where AI-generated libraries were being created with `CollectionType: null` (mixed content) instead of the specified type (movies/tvshows).

**The problem:** When setting `ExcludeFromSearch` on a library, the code was sending only that single option to Emby's `/Library/VirtualFolders/LibraryOptions` API. Emby's API **replaces** the entire `LibraryOptions` object rather than merging, which wiped out all other settings including `ContentType`.

**The fix:** The `setLibraryOptions` function now:
1. Fetches the existing `LibraryOptions` from the library first
2. Merges the new settings into the existing options
3. POSTs the complete merged object back

This ensures all library settings are preserved while still enabling `ExcludeFromSearch`.

**If you were affected:** Re-run the "Build Aperture Movie Libraries" and/or "Build Aperture Series Libraries" jobs to recreate the libraries with the correct collection type.

### Metadata Sync Fix

Fixed an issue where **posters and metadata wouldn't update** for movies/series that already existed in your library.

**The problem:** When syncing from Emby/Jellyfin, if a movie existed by title+year but had a different internal ID (common with STRM libraries), the metadata update was silently skipped.

**The fix:** The sync jobs now properly update metadata for items matched by title+year, ensuring poster fixes and other changes in your media server are reflected in Aperture.

### Recently Watched Sorting

Fixed movies appearing in wrong order in Recently Watched. The issue was caused by NULL timestamps being sorted incorrectly.

### Rating Timestamps

Fixed an issue where **all ratings showed today's date** after a Trakt sync.

**The problem:** A database trigger was overwriting `updated_at` on every sync, even when ratings hadn't changed. Additionally, the Trakt sync was unconditionally updating timestamps.

**The fix:**

- Removed the interfering database trigger (via migration)
- Trakt sync now only updates timestamps when the rating value actually changes
- Migration automatically resets corrupted timestamps for existing users

### AI Explanation Batch Size (Ollama Context Window Fix)

The recommender now automatically adapts explanation generation based on your AI provider's context window:

| Provider                                                | Batch Size | Max Output Tokens |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Large context** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek) | 10 items   | 3,000             |
| **Medium context** (Groq)                               | 5 items    | 1,500             |
| **Small context** (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)           | 3 items    | 1,000             |

**Context window requirements:**

| Batch Size | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Needed  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| 10 items   | ~1,500       | 3,000         | ~4,500        |
| 5 items    | ~900         | 1,500         | ~2,400        |
| 3 items    | ~600         | 1,000         | **~1,600** ✅ |

With the reduced batch size, explanation generation now fits comfortably within **Ollama's default 4096 context window** — no need to manually increase `num_ctx`. The same recommendations are generated, just in smaller batches.

**Also improved:**

- Better error handling when AI returns malformed JSON (handles markdown code blocks, preamble text)
- Error messages now properly logged instead of empty `{}`

### Watch History Sync Improvements

**Full sync is now the default** — The scheduled watch history sync jobs now always perform a **full sync** instead of delta sync. This ensures all watched items are captured, even if movies were added to Aperture after you'd already watched them.

**Consolidated jobs** — The separate "Full Sync Watch History" manual jobs have been removed. The regular sync jobs now handle everything:

| Old Jobs                                | New (Consolidated)                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Sync Movie Watch History (delta)        | **Sync Movie Watch History** (full)  |
| Full Sync Movie Watch History (manual)  | ❌ Removed                           |
| Sync Series Watch History (delta)       | **Sync Series Watch History** (full) |
| Full Sync Series Watch History (manual) | ❌ Removed                           |

**Pre-recommendation sync** — The recommender also syncs watch history immediately before generating recommendations, ensuring recently watched content is properly excluded.

**Why this matters:** Delta sync could miss items if you watched something, then later added that movie/series to Aperture. The delta sync only checked for items modified after the last sync, missing those historical watches. Full sync catches everything.

### Playlist Overview Fix

Fixed an issue where **playlist descriptions weren't being saved** when creating or updating playlists. The fix ensures the correct item ID is used when posting updates to Emby/Jellyfin.

### Similar Content & Search Fix

Fixed a database error (`relation "embeddings" does not exist`) that broke:
- **Similar Movies list** on movie detail pages
- **Similar Series list** on series detail pages  
- **Semantic search** when searching with AI embeddings enabled

**The problem:** Migration 0078 renamed embedding tables to dimension-specific names (e.g., `embeddings_1536`, `embeddings_3072`) to support multiple embedding models, but several API routes were still using the old hardcoded table names.

**The fix:** All routes now dynamically determine the correct embedding table based on your configured model.

### Database Purge Fix

Fixed the database purge and stats functions to work with the new multi-dimension embedding tables. Previously, purging the database would fail or miss embeddings stored in the dimension-specific tables.

### Lint Fixes

- Fixed React Hook dependency warning in `RunningJobsWidget`
- Removed unused import in jobs routes

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Discovery Detail Modal (Mobile)

The discovery detail modal is now **scrollable on mobile devices**. Previously, content would overflow and be inaccessible on smaller screens.

### Database Purge Confirmation

Added a proper confirmation modal when purging the database:
- **Clear warning** showing exactly what will be deleted with counts
- **Text confirmation** — you must type "yes I am sure" before the delete button is enabled
- Prevents accidental data loss

### Renamed Library Build Jobs

The STRM/symlink library creation jobs now have clearer names:

| Old Name              | New Name                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sync Movie Libraries  | **Build Aperture Movie Libraries**  |
| Sync Series Libraries | **Build Aperture Series Libraries** |

This better reflects what these jobs do — they _build_ the AI recommendation libraries in your media server.
