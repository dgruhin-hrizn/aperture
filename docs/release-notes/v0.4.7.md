# Aperture v0.4.7 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This is a minor maintenance release with bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Metadata Sync Fix

Fixed an issue where **posters and metadata wouldn't update** for movies/series that already existed in your library.

**The problem:** When syncing from Emby/Jellyfin, if a movie existed by title+year but had a different internal ID (common with STRM libraries), the metadata update was silently skipped.

**The fix:** The sync jobs now properly update metadata for items matched by title+year, ensuring poster fixes and other changes in your media server are reflected in Aperture.

### Lint Fixes

- Fixed React Hook dependency warning in `RunningJobsWidget`
- Removed unused import in jobs routes

---

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Renamed Library Build Jobs

The STRM/symlink library creation jobs now have clearer names:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| Sync Movie Libraries | **Build Aperture Movie Libraries** |
| Sync Series Libraries | **Build Aperture Series Libraries** |

This better reflects what these jobs do — they *build* the AI recommendation libraries in your media server.
