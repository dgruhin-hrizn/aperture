# Aperture v0.4.7 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release focuses on dashboard improvements and bug fixes to make your home screen more useful.

---

## ✨ New Features

### Two-Column Recently Watched

The Recently Watched card on the dashboard now displays **Movies** and **Series** in separate columns, making better use of the available space.

- **Movies column** (left): Shows your recently watched movies with play count
- **Series column** (right): Shows recently watched series with the last episode watched (e.g., S2E5)

### Improved Time Display

- **Recently Watched**: Now shows months and years for older items (e.g., "2mo 15d ago", "1y 3mo ago")
- **Recent Ratings**: Displays "Rated on Jan 11, 2026" format instead of relative time

### Libraries Excluded from Global Search

AI-generated libraries are now **excluded from global search** in Emby/Jellyfin. This keeps your search results clean — when you search for a movie, you'll only see results from your main libraries, not duplicates from AI recommendation libraries.

**Affected libraries:**

- 🍿 AI Movie Recommendations
- 📺 AI Series Recommendations
- 🏆 Top Picks libraries
- 👀 Shows You Watch libraries

**Note:** Re-running the "Build Aperture Libraries" job will apply this setting to existing libraries.

### Library Default Sort: Date Added

AI recommendation libraries now **default to "Date Added" sort** (newest first) when users first visit them. This means your most recent recommendations appear at the top.

- Set automatically when granting users library access
- Uses the correct Emby Web / Jellyfin Web client identifiers
- Once a user changes their sort preference, it's remembered by their browser

**Affected libraries:**

- 🍿 AI Movie Recommendations
- 📺 AI Series Recommendations
- 🏆 Top Picks libraries
- 👀 Shows You Watch libraries

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Metadata Sync Fix

Fixed an issue where **posters and metadata wouldn't update** for movies/series that already existed in your library.

**The problem:** When syncing from Emby/Jellyfin, if a movie existed by title+year but had a different internal ID (common with STRM libraries), the metadata update was silently skipped.

**The fix:** The sync jobs now properly update metadata for items matched by title+year, ensuring poster fixes and other changes in your media server are reflected in Aperture.

### Recently Watched Sorting

Fixed movies appearing in wrong order in Recently Watched. The issue was caused by NULL timestamps being sorted incorrectly.

### Rating Timestamps

Fixed an issue where **all ratings showed today's date** after a Trakt sync.

**The problem:** A database trigger was overwriting `updated_at` on every sync, even when ratings hadn't changed. Additionally, the Trakt sync was unconditionally updating timestamps.

**The fix:**

- Removed the interfering database trigger (via migration)
- Trakt sync now only updates timestamps when the rating value actually changes
- Migration automatically resets corrupted timestamps for existing users

### AI Explanation Batch Size (Ollama Context Window Fix)

The recommender now automatically adapts explanation generation based on your AI provider's context window:

| Provider                                                | Batch Size | Max Output Tokens |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **Large context** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek) | 10 items   | 3,000             |
| **Small context** (Ollama, Groq, OpenAI-compatible)     | 5 items    | 1,500             |

**Context window requirements:**

| Batch Size | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Needed  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| 10 items   | ~1,500       | 3,000         | ~4,500        |
| 5 items    | ~900         | 1,500         | **~2,400** ✅ |

With the reduced batch size, explanation generation now fits comfortably within **Ollama's default 4096 context window** — no need to manually increase `num_ctx`. The same recommendations are generated, just in smaller batches.

### Playlist Overview Fix

Fixed an issue where **playlist descriptions weren't being saved** when creating or updating playlists. The fix ensures the correct item ID is used when posting updates to Emby/Jellyfin.

### Lint Fixes

- Fixed React Hook dependency warning in `RunningJobsWidget`
- Removed unused import in jobs routes

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Renamed Library Build Jobs

The STRM/symlink library creation jobs now have clearer names:

| Old Name              | New Name                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sync Movie Libraries  | **Build Aperture Movie Libraries**  |
| Sync Series Libraries | **Build Aperture Series Libraries** |

This better reflects what these jobs do — they _build_ the AI recommendation libraries in your media server.
