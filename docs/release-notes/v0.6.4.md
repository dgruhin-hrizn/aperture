## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Input Fields Losing Focus in New Playlist Modal

When creating or editing a playlist, typing in any input field (Preferences, Playlist Name, Description) would cause the cursor to jump out of the field after each character. This made it impossible to type normally.

**Root cause:** The `Section` and `AIButton` helper components were defined inside the parent component, causing React to treat them as new components on every keystroke and unmount/remount the inputs.

**Fix:** Moved these components outside the parent function so they maintain stable references across renders.
