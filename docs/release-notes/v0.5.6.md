# Aperture v0.5.6 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release fixes an issue with custom embedding models and adds a small UI improvement to the admin area.

## 🤖 Custom Embedding Model Dimensions Fix

Fixed an issue where custom embedding models (like Ollama's `qwen3-embedding:8b`) would fail with:

```
❌ Job failed: No embedding model configured or dimensions unknown
```

### What Was Happening

When you add a custom embedding model, the embedding dimensions are stored in the database's `custom_ai_models` table. However, when running embedding jobs, the system only checked the hardcoded model registry for known models — it never looked up custom models from the database.

This meant custom embedding models would:
- ✅ Pass the connection test
- ✅ Show as configured in settings
- ❌ Fail when actually running any embedding job

### The Fix

The `getCurrentEmbeddingDimensions()` function now:
1. First checks built-in models from the hardcoded registry
2. If not found, queries the `custom_ai_models` table
3. Returns the embedding dimensions you specified when adding the model

### What's Now Working

All embedding-related functionality now works with custom models:
- ✅ Generate Movie Embeddings
- ✅ Generate Series Embeddings
- ✅ Generate Episode Embeddings
- ✅ Semantic Search
- ✅ Similarity Graphs
- ✅ Recommendations
- ✅ Taste Profiles
- ✅ AI Assistant queries

## 🎨 Running Jobs Badge on Admin Tab

The **Jobs** tab in the admin navigation now shows a badge with the count of currently running jobs, matching the existing behavior on the sub-tabs (Movies, Series, Global).

This makes it easier to see at a glance whether jobs are running without having to navigate to the Jobs page.

## 🚀 Update Instructions

# Pull the latest image
