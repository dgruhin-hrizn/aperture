# Aperture v0.3.6 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release brings major improvements to Top Picks configuration and a new File Locations setup step to help users with non-standard Docker setups. Here's what's new:

---

## 📂 File Locations Configuration

A new setup step and settings page to configure path mappings between Aperture and your media server:

**The Problem:** Users with non-default Docker volume mounts would see "path does not exist" errors when Aperture tried to create symlinks. The paths Aperture sees internally don't always match what your media server sees.

**The Solution:**

- **Auto-Detection** — click a button to automatically discover the correct paths by comparing how your media server and Aperture see the same files
- **Manual Configuration** — set the Aperture Libraries Path and Media Server Path Prefix yourself
- **Skip Option** — use defaults if you have a standard Unraid setup

Find this in the Setup Wizard (Step 4) or **Admin → Settings → Setup → File Locations**.

## 🎬 Top Picks: Separate Movies & Series Settings

Top Picks configuration is now split into separate sections for Movies and Series:

- **Independent popularity sources** — use MDBList for movies and local popularity for series (or any combination)
- **Different list selections** — pick different MDBList lists for each media type
- **Separate sort options** — sort movies by IMDb rating but series by popularity
- **Side-by-side cards** — easily compare and configure both at once

---

## 📊 MDBList Sort Options & Preview

When using MDBList as a popularity source, you now have control over sorting:

- **Sort dropdown** — choose from IMDb Rating, TMDb Rating, RT Critics, RT Audience, IMDb Popularity, TMDb Popularity, Letterboxd, and more
- **Library Match Preview** — see which items from the list actually match your library before saving
- **Item counts** — shows how many items are in each list

This helps you fine-tune which content appears in your Top Picks.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Studio logos infinite loop** — fixed an issue where the studio logo enrichment job could run forever
- **Series Emby link** — fixed incorrect link generation for series in Emby (community contribution)
- **MDBList API format** — handle new response format for list items
