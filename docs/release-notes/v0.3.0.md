# Aperture v0.3.0 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

A quick bug fix release addressing a database error some users hit during bulk sync operations.

---

## 🐛 PostgreSQL Array Fix

**The Problem:** Users with large libraries would occasionally see this error during sync:

```
ERROR: cannot cast type text[][] to text[]
```

This happened when PostgreSQL tried to insert arrays of data using bulk operations, but the type inference was incorrect.

**The Fix:** Explicit type casting in bulk insert queries ensures PostgreSQL handles arrays correctly, regardless of library size.
