# Aperture v0.3.2 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

We've got another update that improves the browsing experience and fixes some important bugs. Here's what's new:

---

## 🖼️ Media Image Proxy (Mixed Content Fix)

**The Problem:** If you're accessing Aperture through a reverse proxy with HTTPS (like most of us do), you've probably seen broken images or mixed content warnings. This happened because Aperture was loading images directly from your Emby/Jellyfin server over HTTP.

**The Fix:** All media server images now route through Aperture's new image proxy endpoint (`/api/media/images/*`). This means:
- No more mixed content warnings when using HTTPS
- Images load correctly even when accessing externally
- Aggressive caching (24h cache, 7-day stale-while-revalidate) for performance
- Automatic fallback to a placeholder when images fail to load

This applies to posters, backdrops, actor thumbnails, and all other media server images across the entire app.

## 🎬 Person & Studio Detail Pages

You can now click on actors, directors, studios, and networks throughout the app to see dedicated detail pages!

**Person Detail Pages** (`/person/:name`)
- Header with profile image and name
- Carousel of movies they appear in
- Carousel of series they appear in
- Works for actors AND directors

**Studio Detail Pages** (`/studio/:name`)
- Header with studio/network logo
- Carousel of their movies
- Carousel of their series
- Works for production studios AND TV networks

**Where you can click:**
- Watch Stats page: Actors, Directors, Studios, Networks are all now clickable
- More click-through navigation coming in future updates

## 📱 Mobile Responsive Fixes

Fixed horizontal scrolling issues on mobile devices (tested on iPhone 15):

- **Main Layout:** Added `overflow-x: hidden` and `maxWidth: 100%` to prevent content overflow
- **Page Headers:** Added `flexWrap` to headers on Recommendations, Top Picks pages so buttons wrap properly
- **Movies Filters:** Filter controls now stack vertically on mobile instead of overflowing
- **Quick Stats Bar:** Now displays as a 2x2 grid on mobile instead of a horizontal scroll
- **Settings Tabs:** Main tabs now scroll horizontally on mobile (7 tabs don't fit on small screens)

The app should now feel much better on phones and tablets.
