# Aperture v0.6.2 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This is a quick patch release that fixes an issue with the setup wizard.

## 🎨 Improvements

### Match Percentage Overlay Moved to Bottom Right

The match percentage overlay on recommendation posters has been moved from the top right corner to the bottom right corner for better visual balance.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed: "No models Available" in Setup Wizard

Users were unable to select AI models (including OpenAI) in the setup wizard dropdown, seeing "No models Available" instead. This was caused by outdated schema enum values in the setup API endpoints that didn't match what the frontend sends.

The admin settings page was unaffected because it uses different endpoints with the correct schema values.

### Fixed: Additional Setup Wizard Schema Mismatches

Fixed three additional setup wizard endpoints that had the same schema mismatch issue:
- Get AI function config (`GET /api/setup/ai/:function`)
- Test AI provider (`POST /api/setup/ai/test`)
- Update AI function config (`PATCH /api/setup/ai/:function`)

### Fixed: Auto-Request Top Picks Job Not Schedulable

The `auto-request-top-picks` job was missing from the job configuration registry, causing "Job not found" errors when trying to schedule it.

### Fixed: Discovery Content Requests Failing

Requesting content from the Discover page could fail with a foreign key constraint error if the discovery candidate had been cleaned up during a refresh. The request now proceeds gracefully without the candidate link.

### Fixed: Stale Discovery Page After Job Refresh

The Discover page now automatically detects when discovery suggestions have been refreshed (e.g., by a scheduled job) and reloads the data instead of showing stale cached results. This prevents errors when trying to request content that was generated in a previous run.
