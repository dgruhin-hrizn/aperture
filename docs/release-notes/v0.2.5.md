# Aperture v0.2.5 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release is all about **performance**. If you have a large library, sync jobs are now dramatically faster. Here's what changed:

---

## ⚡ 10x Faster Sync

Massive performance improvements across all sync operations:

- **Bulk SQL operations** instead of one-by-one inserts
- **Parallel processing** where safe (metadata enrichment, watch history)
- **Optimized queries** that minimize database round-trips
- Libraries with 10,000+ items now sync in minutes instead of hours

---

## 🎯 OMDb Paid Tier Toggle

If you have an OMDb paid API key with higher rate limits:

- **Enable paid tier** in Settings → Integrations → OMDb
- **Faster enrichment** — paid keys allow 100,000 requests/day vs 1,000
- Aperture will respect the higher limits when enabled

---

## 🔄 Incremental Watching Updates

The "Sync Watching" job is now smarter:

- **Only fetches changes** since the last sync (not your entire history)
- **Faster updates** for "Shows You Watch" and "Continue Watching" libraries
- Less load on your media server

---
