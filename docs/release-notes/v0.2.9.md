# Aperture v0.2.9 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

A focused security update to keep your credentials safe in logs.

---

## 🔒 Log Security

Sensitive data is now automatically redacted from all log output:

- **API keys** — OpenAI, TMDb, OMDb, and media server keys are obfuscated
- **Passwords** — database passwords and any auth credentials
- **Tokens** — OAuth tokens and session identifiers

**What you'll see:**

Instead of:
```
Connecting to Emby with API key: abc123secretkey456
```

You'll now see:
```
Connecting to Emby with API key: abc1***6
```

This protects you if you share logs when troubleshooting or if logs are accidentally exposed.
