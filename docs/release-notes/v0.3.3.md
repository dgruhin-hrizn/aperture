# Aperture v0.3.3 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This is a feature-packed release introducing MDBList integration, a new API error alerting system, and significant performance improvements. Here's everything:

---

## 📋 MDBList Integration

Aperture now integrates with MDBList for enhanced metadata enrichment:

- **Audience scores** — Rotten Tomatoes audience ratings, Letterboxd scores
- **Streaming availability** — see where content is available to stream
- **Popularity metrics** — IMDb popularity rankings
- **Additional metadata** — certifications, keywords, and more

Configure your MDBList API key in **Admin → Settings → Integrations**.

---

## ⚠️ API Error Alerting System

A new system to track and display API errors in a user-friendly way:

- **Error dashboard** — see all API issues at a glance
- **Smart categorization** — errors grouped by type (rate limit, auth, outage, etc.)
- **Dismissible alerts** — clear errors once you've addressed them
- **Auto-retry logic** — transient errors automatically retry

When an external API (TMDb, OMDb, MDBList, OpenAI) has issues, you'll see a clear alert explaining what happened and what to do.

## 🖼️ Rotating Fanart Backdrops

Person and Studio detail pages now feature rotating fanart:

- **Dynamic backgrounds** — cycles through available fanart images
- **Smooth crossfade** — elegant transitions between images
- **Falls back gracefully** — shows solid background if no fanart available

---

## ⚡ 10x Faster Embedding Insertion

Thanks to a community contribution, embedding insertion is now dramatically faster:

- **Bulk insertion** — insert hundreds of embeddings in a single query
- **Reduced database load** — fewer connections and transactions
- **Faster enrichment** — large libraries process much quicker

Big thanks to the community for this performance improvement!
