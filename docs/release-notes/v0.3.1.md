# Aperture v0.3.1 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release fixes STRM file paths and an issue with studio embeddings.

---

## 📁 STRM File Path Fix

**The Problem:** STRM files were being generated with streaming URLs that included API keys, which caused issues with some media server setups and wasn't ideal for security.

**The Fix:** STRM files now use the original file paths from your library instead of streaming URLs:

- **Direct file paths** — points to the actual media file location
- **No API keys exposed** — cleaner and more secure
- **Better compatibility** — works with more media server configurations

## 🎬 Studios Embedding Fix

**The Problem:** When generating AI embeddings, studio data could be in different formats (string vs object) depending on how it was stored, causing embedding failures.

**The Fix:** Studio data is now normalized to a consistent format before embedding:

- Handles both string and object studio formats
- Prevents embedding generation failures
- More reliable AI recommendations
