# Aperture v0.2.7 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release adds a helpful maintenance tool and improves the backup experience. Here's what's new:

---

## 🔧 Missing Poster Repair Tool

A new maintenance tool to fix posters that didn't download correctly:

- **Scan for missing posters** — finds movies/series without images
- **Automatic repair** — re-downloads missing posters from your media server
- **Real-time progress** — watch the repair happen with a live progress bar
- Access from **Admin → Settings → Maintenance**

This is useful if you had network issues during initial sync or if posters got corrupted.

## 💾 Backup Improvements

Backups are now faster and more controllable:

- **pg_dump custom format** — significantly smaller backup files and faster restores
- **Cancel running backups** — stop a backup in progress if needed
- **Better progress tracking** — see real-time file size growth during backup
- **Improved restore** — custom format restores are much faster than SQL dumps

## 📊 Cost Estimator Enhancements

The AI cost estimator is more accurate:

- **Includes all job types** — embeddings, recommendations, and assistant suggestions
- **Shows pending embeddings** — see how many items still need AI processing
- **Updated pricing** — reflects current OpenAI model costs
