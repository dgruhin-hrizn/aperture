# Aperture v0.1.4 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This is a big feature release that adds TV series support, a new rating system, Trakt integration, and configurable job scheduling. Here's everything that's new:

---

## 📺 Browse Series

Series are now first-class citizens in Aperture! You can browse your entire TV library with the same rich interface as movies:

- **Full series grid** with poster cards
- **Season and episode details** when you click into a show
- **Watch progress** displayed right on the poster
- Works with both Emby and Jellyfin

## ❤️ Heart Rating System

A new 10-heart rating scale lets you tell Aperture what you love:

- **Rate any movie or series** from 1 to 10 hearts
- **Visual heart icons** fill as you hover to select your rating
- Ratings feed into the recommendation algorithm to improve suggestions
- Your ratings are stored locally in Aperture (not pushed to your media server)

## 🔗 Trakt Integration

Connect your Trakt account to sync watch history and ratings:

- **OAuth authentication** — secure connection without sharing passwords
- **Sync watched movies and shows** from your Trakt history
- **Pull ratings** from Trakt into Aperture
- Configure sync in **Admin → Settings → Integrations**

## ⏰ Job Scheduler

Take control of when Aperture's background jobs run:

- **Configurable schedules** for every job type (sync, recommendations, etc.)
- **Cron-style expressions** for precise scheduling
- **Enable/disable jobs** individually
- **Run manually** anytime from the Jobs page
- **Job history** shows past runs with success/failure status
