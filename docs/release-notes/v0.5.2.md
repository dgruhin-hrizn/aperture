# Aperture v0.5.2 Release Notes

Hey everyone! 👋

This release adds **OpenRouter support** as a new AI provider, along with custom model persistence and provider logo improvements.

---

## 🤖 OpenRouter Provider Support

You can now use **OpenRouter** as your AI provider! OpenRouter gives you access to hundreds of models from different providers through a single API.

### How to Use

1. Go to **Admin → Settings → AI / LLM**
2. Select **OpenRouter** from the provider dropdown
3. Enter your API key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
4. Click **Add Custom Model...** to enter any model name
5. Test the connection and save

### Custom Models Only

OpenRouter doesn't have a prebuilt model list — you enter the exact model ID you want to use:

- `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`
- `openai/gpt-4o`
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash`
- `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`

Find available models at [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models).

## 💾 Custom Model Persistence

Custom models for **Ollama**, **OpenAI-Compatible**, and **OpenRouter** providers are now saved to the database.

### What This Means

- **Before** — Custom models were lost when you refreshed the page
- **After** — Custom models persist across sessions and server restarts

### Test Before Save

Custom models now require a successful connection test before they can be added. This prevents typos and ensures the model actually works.

## 🎨 Provider Logos

The AI provider dropdown now shows actual provider logos instead of generic cloud icons.

| Provider | Logo |
|----------|------|
| OpenAI | ✓ |
| Anthropic | ✓ |
| Ollama | ✓ |
| OpenRouter | ✓ |
| Groq | ✓ |
| DeepSeek | ✓ |
| Google AI | ✓ |

Logos automatically invert colors in dark mode for visibility.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### NFO Provider IDs Fixed

Fixed an issue where NFO files had incorrect provider IDs, breaking playback tracking in media servers.

- **Before** — Provider IDs were malformed
- **After** — Real provider IDs are used for proper playback sync

### Docker SESSION_SECRET Fix

Fixed YAML parsing issues with `SESSION_SECRET` in docker-compose files by properly quoting the value.

---

## 🚀 Update Instructions

### For Docker Users

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# Restart with new version
docker compose up -d
```

### Database Migration

The update includes a database migration (`0090_openrouter_provider.sql`) that runs automatically on startup.

### Post-Update Steps

1. **Clear browser cache** — Or hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Re-add custom models** — If you had custom Ollama models before, you'll need to add them again (they'll now persist!)
