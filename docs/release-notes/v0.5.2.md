## v0.5.2 Release Notes

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Playback Tracking Restored

Fixed an issue where played content wasn't being tracked correctly in Emby/Jellyfin.

**What was wrong:** NFO files were using fake provider IDs (`aperture1234` style) instead of real IMDB/TMDB/TVDB IDs, which broke playback state syncing.

**What's fixed:** NFO files now use your actual provider IDs again, so watch progress tracks properly.

### 📄 Windows Docker Desktop Support

Added `docker-compose.windows.yml` and full setup documentation for running Aperture in Docker Desktop alongside a native Windows Emby/Jellyfin installation.

---

**Upgrade:** Pull the latest image and rebuild your libraries to regenerate NFO files with correct IDs.

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

Then run **Admin → Jobs → Build Libraries** for affected users.
