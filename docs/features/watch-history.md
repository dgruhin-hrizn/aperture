## How Watch History Affects Recommendations

Your watch history directly influences AI recommendations:

- **Recently watched** content is excluded from recommendations
- **Genres you watch** are weighted in your taste profile
- **Directors/actors** you watch frequently are considered
- **Franchises** you've engaged with are tracked

---

## Syncing

Watch history syncs from your media server:

- **Automatic** — Runs on a schedule (typically every 1-2 hours)
- **Full sync** — Catches all historical watches
- **Pre-recommendation** — Syncs before generating new recommendations

If you just watched something and don't see it:
- Wait for the next sync
- Ask your admin to run a manual sync
