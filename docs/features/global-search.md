## Semantic Search

If your admin has enabled AI embeddings, search also uses **semantic matching**:

- Find content by description, not just title
- Search "mind-bending sci-fi" to find movies like Inception
- Search "heartwarming family films" for appropriate matches

## Search Tips

| Search For | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Exact title | "The Dark Knight" |
| Partial title | "dark knight" |
| Actor name | "Tom Hanks" |
| Director | "Christopher Nolan" |
