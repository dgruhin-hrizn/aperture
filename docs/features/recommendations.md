## How Recommendations Are Generated

### Input Data

The AI considers:

1. **Watch History** — What you've watched
2. **Ratings** — How you rated content
3. **Time Patterns** — When you watch
4. **Genres** — Your genre preferences
5. **People** — Directors, actors you favor
6. **Franchises** — Collections you engage with

### Scoring Factors

Each candidate is scored with configurable weights:

| Factor | Default Weight | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Similarity** | Varies | Match to your taste profile |
| **Popularity** | Varies | General audience appeal |
| **Recency** | Varies | Preference for newer content |
| **Rating** | Varies | Community/critic scores |
| **Diversity** | Varies | Variety in the list |

You can customize these weights in [AI Algorithm Settings](user-settings/ai-algorithm.md).

2. Wait for the next scheduled run
3. Your watch activity will be synced first

**Note:** Watch history syncs before each recommendation run to ensure recently watched content is excluded.
